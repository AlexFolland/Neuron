# Neuron

Neuron is a full featured action Bar addon for World of Warcraft: Legion, updated for Patch 7.3

## Manual Install:
After download and extracting, make sure to move the *Neuron-GUI, Neuron-Menu, Neuron-Pet, Neuron-Status, and Neuron-Bag* out of the **Neuron** directory. Move the aforementioned five directories as well as the Neuron directory to the **World of Warcraft>Interface>addons** directory.

When the addon is successfully installed the World of **Warcraft>Interface>addons** directory should contain 6 separate folders at the same level:
 * Neuron
 * Neuron-GUI
 * Neuron-Menu
 * Neuron-Pet
 * Neuron-Bag
 * Neuron-Status

## Download:
The addon can be downloaded here:
* https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/279283-neuron  
or:
* https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/neuron


## Modules:
Neuron comes bundled with four modules that can be used for a full featured action bar experience. These modules are optional and can be disabled, but it is highly recommended that they be used for the best experience.

* Neuron: Menu
* Neuron: Status
* Neuron: Bag
* Neuron: Pet

## Theme Support:

Neuron inherits all theming courtesy of the **[Masque](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/masque "Masque")** addon. Neuron has full Masque compatibility, and the theming options found in Masque are quite in-depth, not to mention the robust portfolio of skins made to support Masque. In short, you can make your bars look any way you like!


## Features:
* Neuron features an unlimited number of macros. You can create as many bars/buttons as you want/need per character!
* Are you a keybinder extreme? Use the button storage area for all your macros/keybindings! No buttons on screen needed!
* Are you a clicker extraordinaire? As many buttons on the screen you want where you want, when you want!
* Macros the size of Texas! Up to 1024 characters in length!
* Maul's unique mouse-over key-binding system - where the mouse-over binding system was born!
* Many other of the favorite desired bar addon features and then some!
* And, last but not least, **MASQUE support!**


## Graphical Editor:
Neuron contains a graphical bar editor that allows for nearly endless customization to bar shape, size, orientation, and much more! Further, Neuron has neither the limitations on max number of bars nor on the max number of buttons per bar, as you might find in addons such as Bartender4 or Dominoes. 

If the command line is your thing, all of the options found in the graphical bar editor can also be set using the below command structure.

## Credits:

Neuron is a fork of the amazing *Ion Action Bars* addon started by Connor Chenoweth aka **Maul**, for World of Warcraft Legion and onwards. All credit for the bulk of this addon should go to him accordingly, along with SLOKnightFall for his maintainership throughout the years. If you would like to use the ongoing continuation of the Ion addon instead of Neuron, please find it on either Curse or WowInterface.
