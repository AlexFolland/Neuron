Neuron
===

Neuron is a full featured action Bar addon for World of Warcraft: Legion, updated for Patch 7.3



Neuron is a fork of the amazing "Ion Action Bars" addon started my Maul. All credits for the framework of this addon should go to him accordingly, along with SLOKnightFall for his maintainership through the years. If you would like to use the continuation of the Ion addon instead of Neuron, please find it on either Curse or WowInterface.
