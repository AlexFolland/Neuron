# Neuron

Neuron is a full featured action Bar addon for World of Warcraft: Legion, updated for Patch 7.3

## Install:
To install, make sure to move the *Neuron-GUI, Neuron-Menu, Neuron-Pet, Neuron-Status, and Neuron-Bag* out of the **Neuron** directory, as they are each their own addons. Move the afformentioned 5 directories as well as the Neuron directory to the World of Warcraft>Interface>addons directory.

When the addon is successfully installed the World of Warcraft directory should contain 6 separate folders at the same level:
 * Neuron
 * Neuron-GUI
 * Neuron-Menu
 * Neuron-Pet
 * Neuron-Bag
 * Neuron-Status

## Download:
The addon can be downloaded here:

### Credits:
Neuron is a fork of the amazing "Ion Action Bars" addon started my Maul. All credits for the framework of this addon should go to him accordingly, along with SLOKnightFall for his maintainership through the years. If you would like to use the continuation of the Ion addon instead of Neuron, please find it on either Curse or WowInterface.
